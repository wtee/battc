battc.sh is a collection of closely related shell scripts
that display a laptop's battery status in a simple form
suitable for inclusion in a command prompt, in Conky,
or simply as a command-line utility.



*NOTE:* The Mac versions are no longer supported since
my MacBook met it's maker. They did work with Leopard
and Snow Leopard, however, and should work as long as
Apple doesn't change pmset's output.

- batt.sh -- simple, no color output for Linux
- batt_osx.sh -- simple, no color output for OS X
- battc.sh -- color output for Linux console
- battc_conky.sh -- color output for Conky on Linux
- battc_osx.sh -- color output for OS X

All these scripts should work with bash or ksh and
those without color output should work with plain-old sh
as well.

All these scripts are in the public domain, so tweak them
and port them to your heart's content.
